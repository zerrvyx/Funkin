# Friday Night Funkin' - ProjectFNF

## Installation:

Go [here](https://github.com/l1ttleO/ProjectFNF/releases/latest) and download the appropriate version for your OS

## Building:
You must have the most up-to-date version of Haxe, seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
