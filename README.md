A note on https://github.com/ProjectFNF/ProjectFNF  
So here's the story in a nutshell:  
There was [ProjectFNF 1.0](https://github.com/aflacc/ProjectFNF) (which was mostly developed by [Zeptos](https://github.com/MagnusStrom)), then I decided to create ProjectFNF 2.0 using Psych Engine and [aflac](https://github.com/aflacc) agreed. Then, aflac gave permission to [east](https://github.com/EastDeveloper) to turn the ProjectFNF Discord server into South Engine, which east claims is "just a rebrand" which I never agreed in the first place (they countered this argument by saying that aflac gave them permission, and I couldn't do anything about it). During this time, I wasn't in the server, so I joined *after* the changes were made. I got frustrated and left. East then turned the Discord server back into ProjectFNF. I took a glance at their repo, and saw that [their](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139134145-e878d519-c6a6-4a9f-9df1-eb301ca17ad9.png) [commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139134360-4e1edca7-aa93-4ffd-aec2-1bffeebd3f6d.png) [history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139279406-e0275609-a95a-4d55-867f-c3ad8bcc3aff.png)
was a mess, filled with tons of "fix" and undescriptive commits. I decided to keep developing OG ProjectFNF 2.0 on my own
